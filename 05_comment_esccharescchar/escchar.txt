Escape characters :

Escape characters in Python are special sequences used to represent characters that are difficult or impossible to type directly into a string. They are typically introduced using a backslash (\). Here are some common escape characters and their meanings:

Escape Character
\n	Newline (moves cursor to the next line)
\t	Tab (adds a tab space)
\\	Backslash (inserts a literal \)
\'	Single quote (useful inside single-quoted strings)
\"	Double quote (useful inside double-quoted strings)
\r	Carriage return (moves cursor to beginning of line)
\b	Backspace (removes the previous character)

Example Usage:

print("Hello\nWorld")  # Moves "World" to a new line
print("Tab\tSpace")    # Adds a tab space between "Tab" and "Space"
print("She said: \"Hello!\"")  # Uses escaped double quotes
