'''
Dunder methods (also called magic methods) are special methods in Python with names having double underscores like __init__, __str__, and __add__.
  > They let you customize how your objects behave with built-in operators, functions, and language features.
  > They make your classes more intuitive, powerful, and Python â€”supporting things like operator overloading, custom string output, and more.
