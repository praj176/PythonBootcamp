'''
Errors and exception handling in Python help ensure that a program can gracefully recover from unexpected issues.
Types of Errors:
- Syntax Errors
- Runtime Errors (Exceptions) â€“ Occur while the program is running (e.g., dividing by zero, accessing an invalid index).

ZeroDivisionError	>  Division by zero (10 / 0)
TypeError           >  Invalid operation between incompatible types ("text" + 5)
IndexError          >  Accessing an out-of-range list index (lst[10] when lst has 5 elements)
KeyError	        > Trying to access a non-existent dictionary key (dict["missing_key"])
ValueError	        > Incorrect value format (int("hello"))
AttributeError	    > Calling an undefined attribute (NoneType object has no attribute .upper())
ImportError	        > Failure to import a module (import nonexistent_module)
FileNotFoundError	> Trying to open a missing file (open("nonexistent.txt"))
