Setters and Getter used for writting cleaner syntax.
Setters and getters are special methods used in object-oriented programming to control access to class attributes.

> Getter: A method that retrieves (gets) the value of an attribute.
Setter: A method that modifies (sets) the value of an attribute while ensuring valid data.

They help protect data, enforce constraints, and maintain clean code.
