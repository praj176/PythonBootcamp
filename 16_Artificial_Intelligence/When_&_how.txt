How and When to Use AI
=======================

These are five strategies to use Artificial Intelligence effectively:

1. Divide and Conquer
---------------------
Break down large problems into manageable sub-problems. 
Segment the workflow and identify sections where AI can automate repetitive tasks. 
This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of coding errors that could potentially crash the entire application.

2. Which tools to use
---------------------
To write code specifically we can use GitHub Copilot free tier.
Extension available in VSCode.
