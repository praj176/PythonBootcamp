How and When to Use AI
=======================

These are five strategies to use Artificial Intelligence effectively:

1. Divide and Conquer
---------------------
Break down large problems into manageable sub-problems. 
Segment the workflow and identify sections where AI can automate repetitive tasks. 
This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of coding errors that could potentially crash the entire application.

2. Which tools to use
---------------------
To write code specifically we can use GitHub Copilot free tier.
Extension available in VSCode.

3. Be very specific with your prompt.
------------------------------------
Specific requirements according to the need of the project.
Mention it very clear so that it yeilds a better outcome.
A good, clear and detailed prompt can make a huge difference in the outcome.

4. Do not rely on AI too much.
-----------------
Reduce the dependancy of AI use, use more brain in solving the problem.
Always use AI as an assistany and do not replace thinking with AI.
Think using your own brain.
Do not use AI for creativity or thinking because that is something AI cannot do.
